Are you depressed? The humor may be the one which isn’t enough in your life….
I don’t have time to worry about who doesn’t like me.  I’m too busy loving the people who love me.
That’s the secret to life ＿ replace one worry with another.
After once successful, it will not hand me do not do it again?
I need plenty of rest in case tomorrow is a great day..
A watched supper dish never fills!
The less you want, the more you love.
Learn from yesterday. Live for today. Look tomorrow.
Be yourself. No one can say you’re doing it wrong.
It’s so nice to know you’re loved.
I love when you’re here.
Happiness is a side-dish of French fries!
I’m a smart person……I just do stupid things..
The trouble with mornings is that they come when you are not awake!
